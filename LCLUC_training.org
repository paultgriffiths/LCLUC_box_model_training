* General comments on atmospheric pollution

** Air pollution is a global problem

#+COMMENT: image downloaded from https://ral.ucar.edu/sites/default/files/public/images/features/cities.png on 20170707


** Biogenic emissions are also important

** COMMENT Regional Haze - Dickey Ridge (split image) looking southwest across the Browntown area into the Shenandoah Valley. Good visibility on the left and poor visibility on the right.

** Primary and secondary pollutants
*Primary* Emitted directly into the atmosphere (usually at the surface)
 - Nitric oxide, NO
 - Volatile organic compounds such as methane, CO
     + Biogenic VOCs suc as isoprene, terpenes, formaldehyde (HCHO)
	 + Anthropogenic VOCs such as benzene, gasoline
 - Primary aerosol such as soot
 - SO_2
*Secondary* Made in the atmosphere by [[oxidation][oxidation]]
 - Ozone, O_3
 - NO_2
 - Formaldehyde (HCHO)

* Quantitative treatment of chemical processes
** Emission and loss - Timescales in atmospheric chemistry
Considering the atmosphere as a whole, or some air-mass within in it, we could
write an equation describing the rate of change ('tendency') of a species.

Prognostic equation for species X, with concentration $x$

\vspace{-0.1in} 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{dx}{dt} &=& R -k x
\end{eqnarray*}

where R is the rate of emission of X and k is a constant

We now have a first-order linear differential equation, which can be
solved to give

\vspace{-0.1in} 
\begin{eqnarray*}
x(t) &=& \frac{R}{k_1}\big(1-\exp (-k_1 t)\big)
\end{eqnarray*}

System has a characteristic time, $\tau = 1/k$
** Time dependence of X

#+NAME: steady_stage

** The rate law
*** Basic points
+ Rate is defined as change in concentration per unit time
+ Natural unit of concentration in air quality modelling: 
  * concentration: *molecules per cm^3 gas* so units are cm$^{-3}$
  * rate: cm$^{-3}$ s$^{-1}$
+ [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_mass_action][Law of Mass Action]] - Double the concentration = Double the rate 

*** NO + O_3 = NO_2 + O_2
+ The rate of change of NO can be expressed as 
\vspace{-0.1in} 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{d [NO]}{dt} &=& -k_1[NO][O_3]
\end{eqnarray*}

+ Similarly, $\frac{d[NO_2]}{dt} = k_1[NO][O_3]$

# *** OH + NO_2 = HNO_3
# \vspace{-0.1in} 
# \begin{eqnarray*}
# \frac{d [\mathrm{HNO_3}]}{dt} &=& k_2[NO_2][OH]
# \end{eqnarray*}


* Emissions and deposition
** Emission of primary pollutants
*** Emissions into a boundary layer - dimensional analysis
+ Emissions per unit surface area: 
 + $E$ with units of molecules cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$
+ Into a well-mixed layer of height $h$ (cm)
*** Rate equation
+ A rate of change of $E/h$
\vspace{-0.1in} 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{d[NO]}{dt} &=& E_{NO}/h
\end{eqnarray*}

** Dry deposition at the surface
+ Flux depends on concentration in gas phase above surface and on the
  reactivity of the surface
+ Flux has units of (molecules) per unit of surface area per unit time (cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$)
\vspace{-0.1in} 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mathrm{Flux} &\propto& C[O_3]
\end{eqnarray*}
+ Units of C are therefore cm s$^{-1}$, a 'velocity', $v$, dependent on surface type
\vspace{-0.1in} 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{d[O_3]}{dt} &=& - \frac{v}{h}[O_3] = - k_1 [O_3]
\end{eqnarray*}

** Photochemistry <<oxidation>>
+ Molecules absorb photons and the chemical bonds are broken - /photolysis/
+ Rate of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photodissociation][photolysis]]
  depends on number of photons of the correct wavelength.
\vspace{-0.1in}
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{d[NO_2]}{dt} &=& - J [NO_2]
\end{eqnarray*}

J depends on molecule and flux of photons (hence: time of day, lat, lon, cloud cover)

** Example: NO2

* Lecture 2
* Formation of OH
* Peroxy radicals formed from OH
* Peroxy radicals form NO2
* NO2 forms ozone
+ Ozone is broken into reactive oxygen (O^1D)
+ The reactive oxygen reacts with water: O^{1}D + H_{2}O = 2 OH
