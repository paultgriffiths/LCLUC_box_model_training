* Lecture 1
** Goals

*** Introduce concepts of atmospheric chemistry
+ Today it's all about ozone
+ Primary/secondary pollutants
+ Emission/deposition
+ Photochemistry
*** Run first numerical simulation of a chemical system
+ Simple photochemical system

*** Code is available [[https://www.gitlab.com/ptg21/LCLUC_presentation][here]]
*** You can clone the code using [[https://git-scm.com/][git]] via 

~git clone git@gitlab.com:ptg21/LCLUC_presentation.git~

** Who is this course for?
*** My goal is to introduce atmospheric chemistry with a focus on tropospheric ozone and other secondary pollutants.
*** I won't discuss the chemistry in detail but will summarise the relevant reactions.  It gets complex towards the end.
*** The goal is to use these reactions to study how ozone levels respond to other pollutants.
*** Our focus is on rates of production of ozone during the day.
*** For the purpose of this course, *everything* is a pollutant.
** Tricks of the trade
*** Mostly think about processes in terms of their characteristic timescales
+ How fast is ozone formed?
+ How fast is transport out of the planetary boundary layer?
+ How does this compare with transport times?
*** What are the important species?
+ Ozone
+ NO_2
+ Aldehydes
+ Oxidants such as OH, NO_{3}
+ Key species such as O^{1}D

** Typical levels of atmospheric constituents

** Primary and secondary pollutants
*Primary* Emitted directly into the atmosphere (usually at the surface)
 - Nitric oxide, NO
 - Volatile organic compounds such as methane, CO
     + Biogenic VOCs suc as isoprene, terpenes, formaldehyde (HCHO)
	 + Anthropogenic VOCs such as benzene, gasoline
 - Primary aerosol such as soot
 - SO_2
*Secondary* Made in the atmosphere by [[oxidation][oxidation]]
 - Ozone, O_3
 - NO_2
 - Formaldehyde (HCHO)

* Quantitative treatment of chemical processes
** Emission and loss - Timescales in atmospheric chemistry
Considering the atmosphere as a whole, or some air-mass within in it, we could
write an equation describing the rate of change ('tendency') of a species.

Prognostic equation for species X, with concentration $x$

\vspace{-0.1in} 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{dx}{dt} &=& R -k x
\end{eqnarray*}

where R is the rate of emission of X and k is a constant

We now have a first-order linear differential equation, which can be
solved to give

\vspace{-0.1in} 
\begin{eqnarray*}
x(t) &=& \frac{R}{k_1}\big(1-\exp (-k_1 t)\big)
\end{eqnarray*}

System has a characteristic time, $\tau = 1/k$
** Time dependence of X
#+CAPTION:  Time dependence of concentration of chemical species X 
#+NAME: steady_stage
[[file:figures/ss.png]]


** The rate law
*** Basic points
+ Rate is defined as change in concentration per unit time
+ Natural unit of concentration in air quality modelling: 
  * concentration: *molecules per cm^3 gas* so units are cm$^{-3}$
  * rate: cm$^{-3}$ s$^{-1}$
+ [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_mass_action][Law of Mass Action]] - Double the concentration = Double the rate 

*** NO + O_3 = NO_2 + O_2
+ The rate of change of NO can be expressed as 
\vspace{-0.1in} 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{d [NO]}{dt} &=& -k_1[NO][O_3]
\end{eqnarray*}

+ Similarly, $\frac{d[NO_2]}{dt} = k_1[NO][O_3]$

# *** OH + NO_2 = HNO_3
# \vspace{-0.1in} 
# \begin{eqnarray*}
# \frac{d [\mathrm{HNO_3}]}{dt} &=& k_2[NO_2][OH]
# \end{eqnarray*}

* Emissions and deposition
** Emission of primary pollutants
*** Emissions into a boundary layer - dimensional analysis
+ Emissions per unit surface area: 
  + Flux $E$ has units of (molecules) per unit of surface area per unit time (cm^{-2} s^{-1})
+ Into a well-mixed layer of height $h$ (cm)
*** Rate equation
+ A rate of change of $E/h$
\vspace{-0.1in} 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{d[NO]}{dt} &=& E_{NO}/h
\end{eqnarray*}
has the correct dimensions (cm^{-3} s^{-1})
** Dry deposition at the surface
+ Flux depends on concentration in gas phase above surface and on the
  reactivity of the surface
+ Flux has units of (molecules) per unit of surface area per unit time (cm^{-2} s^{-1})
\vspace{-0.1in} 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mathrm{Flux} &\propto& C[O_3]
\end{eqnarray*}
+ Units of C are therefore cm s^{-1}, a 'velocity', $v$, dependent on surface type
\vspace{-0.1in} 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{d[O_3]}{dt} &=& - \frac{v}{h}[O_3] = - k_1 [O_3]
\end{eqnarray*}

* Photochemistry
** Photochemistry <<oxidation>>
+ Molecules absorb photons and the chemical bonds are broken - /photolysis/
\vspace{-0.1in}

\begin{eqnarray*}
\mathrm{NO}_2 + hv \rightarrow \mathrm{NO} + \mathrm{O}
\end{eqnarray*}

+ Rate of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photodissociation][photolysis]]
  depends on number of photons of the correct wavelength.
\vspace{-0.1in}
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{d[\mathrm{NO}_2]}{dt} &=& - J [\mathrm{NO}_2]
\end{eqnarray*}

J depends on molecule and flux of photons (hence: time of day, lat, lon, cloud
cover).  Units of J are s^{-1}

** Example: NO2
#+CAPTION: absorption cross-section of NO_2

** Example: NO2

** NO_2/NO 'Photostationary state'
# see http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00022470.1983.10465566
Using the reactions already given, 

\vspace{-0.1in}

\begin{eqnarray*}
\mathrm{NO} + \mathrm{O}_3  & \rightarrow & \mathrm{NO}_2 + \mathrm{O}_2\\
\mathrm{NO}_2 + hv &\rightarrow& \mathrm{NO} + \mathrm{O}\\
\mathrm{O}_2 + \mathrm{O} &\rightarrow & \mathrm{O}_3\\
\end{eqnarray*}

\vspace{-0.15in}

we can write rates of change for each species

\vspace{-0.1in}
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{d[\mathrm{NO}_2]}{dt}  &=& - J_1 [\mathrm{NO}_2] + k_3\mathrm{[NO]}\mathrm{[O}_3]\\
\frac{d[\mathrm{NO]}}{dt}    &=&   J_1 [\mathrm{NO}_2] - k_3\mathrm{[NO]} \mathrm{[O}_3] \\
\frac{d\mathrm{[O]}}{dt}     &=& - k_2 [\mathrm{O}][\mathrm{O}_2] + J_1 [\mathrm{NO}_2] \\
\frac{d\mathrm{[O}_3]}{dt}   &=&   k_2 [\mathrm{O}][\mathrm{O}_2]  - k_3 \mathrm{[NO]} \mathrm{[O}_3]
\end{eqnarray*}

A set of coupled differential equations results!
** How to proceed - I

What is our mechanism going to do?

*** column one
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_col: 0.6
    :END:
+ We can see that NO and ozone make NO2
+ NO2 makes NO and O, and O makes O3
+ so NO2 regenerates the NO and O3
+ This is an active equilibrium - NO and NO2 interconvert, consuming/releasing
  ozone as they do so.

As we shall see in L2, this equilibrium is crucial.

#+CAPTION: NO:NO2 interconversion and concomitant O3 consumption/production
[[file:figures/o3_prod_loss_schematic.png]]

** How to proceed - II
+ So we expect our equations to solve to an equilibrium with zero net rate of
  change

+ There exists a wealth of literature on the solution of these stiff
  differential equations 
  (lifetimes of each species vary by many orders of magnitude, resulting in
  small timesteps).

+ In our example, the lifetime of O is very short, set by k_2[O2], while that
  of NO2 is determined by J and can be much longer.

+ Step forward our numerical ('box') model...

* Box models
** Box models
*** column one
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_col: 0.55
    :END:
+ Box models represent a single representative area of the atmosphere.
+ Notionally 1cm^3 in volume
+ Can be connected to the ground via emission/deposition.
+ Could also be chosen to represent the free troposphere.
+ Need to supply photolysis rates, emissions

** Our mechanism
Our mechanism is rather complex - the CO and NO emissions interact with
sunlight and water vapour

\begin{eqnarray*}
\mathrm{NO}_2 + hv        & \rightarrow & \mathrm{NO} + \mathrm{O} \\
\mathrm{O}_2 + \mathrm{O} & \rightarrow & \mathrm{O}_3 \\
\mathrm{NO} + \mathrm{O}_3 &\rightarrow & \mathrm{NO}_2 + \mathrm{O}_2 \\
\mathrm{O}_3 + hv          & \rightarrow & \mathrm{O}_2 + \mathrm{O1D} \\
\mathrm{O1D} + \mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}  & \rightarrow & 2 \mathrm{OH} \\

\color{red} \mathrm{NO} \color{black}  + \mathrm{HO}_2 &\rightarrow & \mathrm{OH} + \mathrm{NO}_2 
\end{eqnarray*}

Primary species coloured in \color{red} red 
** Some general points
*** VOCs such as CO are degraded by reaction with OH
\vspace{-0.15in}
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mathrm{OH} + \mathrm{CO} +\mathrm{O}_2 & \rightarrow &  \mathrm{HO}_2 + \mathrm{CO}_2 
\end{eqnarray*}
and HO_2 (a class of 'peroxy') radicals are produced.

*** NO2 is produced *additionally* via reaction of peroxy radicals with NO
\vspace{-0.15in}
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mathrm{NO} + \mathrm{HO}_2 &\rightarrow & \mathrm{OH} + \mathrm{NO}_2 
\end{eqnarray*}

*** NO2 photolysis leads to O3
\vspace{-0.15in}
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mathrm{NO}_2 + hv & \rightarrow & \mathrm{NO} + \mathrm{O} \\
\mathrm{O}_2 + \mathrm{O} & \rightarrow & \mathrm{O}_3 
 \end{eqnarray*}

** Implementation in a box model

As a series of tendencies

#+BEGIN_SRC python

    dNO2 = -J1*NO2   + k3*NO*O3 + k8*HO2*NO - k9*OH*NO2 +
	        k13*OH*HONO2

    dNO  =  J1*NO2   - k3*O3*NO - k8*HO2*NO 

    dO3  =  k2*O     - k3*NO*O3 - J4*O3

    dO   =  J1*NO2   - k2*O  + k5*O1D*M

    dOH  =  2.k6*O1D*H2O - k7*OH*CO + k8*HO2*NO +
	        k11*HO2*O3 - k12*OH*O3 - k9*OH*NO2  

    dHO2 =  k7*OH*CO - k8*HO2*NO - k11*HO2*O3 +
	        k12*OH*O3 - k14*HO2*HO2 

    dCO  = -k7*OH*CO 

    dO1D =  J4*O3    - k5*O1D*M     - k6*O1D*H2O

    dHONO2 = k9*OH*NO2 - k13*OH*HONO2
#+END_SRC

* Formation of OH
** Formation of OH from ozone and water vapour
The photochemical oxidant, OH, is formed from ozone and water vapour.

\vspace{-0.15in}
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mathrm{O}_3 + hv & \rightarrow & \mathrm{O}_2 + \mathrm{O1D} \\
\mathrm{O1D} + \mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}  & \rightarrow & 2\color{red} \mathrm{OH} \\
\mathrm{O1D} + \mathrm{N}_2 / \mathrm{O}_2  & \rightarrow &  \mathrm{O} + \mathrm{N}_2 / \mathrm{O}_2  
\end{eqnarray*}

*** Via excited state oxygen atoms - the O1D species. 

These are distinct from the ground state oxygen atoms, O, produced by NO2 photolysis.

*** The photochemical oxidant OH is reactive towards VOCs.  This species initiates the photochemical degradation of VOCs and in the presence of NO will produce ozone.

* Reaction of photochemical oxidant, OH, with VOCs to produce ozone
** Reaction of photochemical oxidant, OH, with VOCs
 Able to react with CO and with other VOC via the H atoms, and so initiate photo-degradation.

 \vspace{-0.15in}
 \begin{eqnarray*}
 \mathrm{OH} + \mathrm{CO} +\mathrm{O}_2 & \rightarrow & \color{red} \mathrm{HO}_2 \color{black} + \mathrm{CO}_2 \\
 \\
 \mathrm{OH} + \mathrm{CH}_4  & \rightarrow & \mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O} + \color{red}  \mathrm{CH}_3\mathrm{O}_2 \\
 \end{eqnarray*} 

 Once produced, these peroxy radicals oxidize NO to NO2 and ozone is produced.

\vspace{-0.15in}
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mathrm{NO} + \mathrm{HO}_2 &\rightarrow & \mathrm{OH} + \mathrm{NO}_2 \\
\mathrm{NO}_2 + hv & \rightarrow & \mathrm{NO} + \mathrm{O} \\
\mathrm{O}_2 + \mathrm{O} & \rightarrow & \mathrm{O}_3 
\end{eqnarray*}

Without the HO_2 the NO reacts with ozone to produce NO2, which recreates the
ozone.  No net ozone production!!
* Conclusions
** Conclusions
*** If you have an air mass with NO, VOC (here CO) and sunlight you can expect ozone formation.

*** The amount of ozone formed also depends on H_{2}O, number of photons (sunlight).

*** You can calculate the rate at which ozone is being formed.

*** Without these ozone will be destroyed

* Practical 2
** Practical 2
+ Open RStudio or R
+ Look at \tt kinetics-box-model-ozone.R
in the src folder.
  + What do equations describe?
  + What do you expect to happen?

*** \color{red} Any Pythonistas in the audience?

** Practical 2 
*** Run the simulation 
+ ~source("kinetics-box-model-ozone.R")~

+ Can you shift the atmosphere from ozone destruction to ozone production?  
+ How?
* Conclusions/next steps
** Next steps
*** Hand coding the tendency functions gets tedious and can be error-prone.
+ Automatic code generation is possible
+ See [[http://people.cs.vt.edu/asandu/Software/Kpp/][KPP]], the /Kinetic
  Pre-Processor/
+ Generates F77, F90, C, Matlab code which you compile and run (or run within Matlab)

+ This has been incorporated into
  [[https://github.com/barronh/DSMACC][DSMACC]]

This is an excellent model but its usage requires good Shell and compiler skills.

*** It's easy to show that J values are key to the chemistry

+Consider using a verifiable radiative transfer model such as [[https://www2.acom.ucar.edu/modeling/tropospheric-ultraviolet-and-visible-tuv-radiation-model][TUV]] (Tropospheric Ultraviolet and Visible TUV model)
